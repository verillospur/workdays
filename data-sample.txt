28/09/2019, 12:56 - Lyuben: Guys, concessions will reduce or increase your working days from next week. 
The company next to me is delivering in the same postcodes and they have 3 concessions per week. 
Be extra careful please 

1.Always call the customers 
2.Write “we missed you” cards 
3.Don’t mark any parcel “missing”. Don’t use “missing” at all

Guys, soon we are going to the busy period. Don’t leave the keys inside the van, or leave the van with running ignition. Every year in October, November and December a lot of vans get stolen. Keep that in mind
28/09/2019, 12:57 - Lyuben: <Media omitted>
28/09/2019, 13:01 - Lyuben: Those are until 25.09, so tomorrow or Monday the full update will come. Tuesday is my checking date with Amazon, so Tuesday next week we will have the full number of the concessions for this week with the contested ones

*Write “we missed you” cards 
*Don’t use “missing” 
Reduce the concessions to appropriate minimum

10/10/2019, 09:17 - Lyuben: Guys,

1. Always ask for document if the parcel is “age verification”!
2. Never open the door, garage door or some other door at customer property.
3. Always lock the van
4. Always take the keys with you! 
5. Never use “missing”! Never!
6. If you can’t deliver the parcel and you try to call the customer, but you can’t - don’t mark the parcel “customer unavailable”. IF YOU CAN’T CALL - DON’T MARK ANYTHING! Return the parcel 

*Always call the customers 
*Write “we missed you” cards 
*Don’t use “missing” 
Reduce the concessions to appropriate minimum

10/10/2019, 13:32 - Lyuben: Actually no, because amazon will not allow it. You need to wait minimum 6 months and working in another depot

14/10/2019, 09:24 - Vasile: Doors open
14/10/2019, 09:34 - Lyuben: Guys, don’t forget bags and “we missed you” cards
14/10/2019, 10:58 - Lyuben: Guys,

1. Always ask for document if the parcel is “age verification”!
2. Never open the door, garage door or some other door at customer property.
3. Always lock the van
4. Always take the keys with you! 
5. Never use “missing”! Never!
6. If you can’t deliver the parcel and you try to call the customer, but you can’t - don’t mark the parcel “customer unavailable”. IF YOU CAN’T CALL - DON’T MARK ANYTHING! Return the parcel 

*Always call the customers 
*Write “we missed you” cards 
*Don’t use “missing” 
Reduce the concessions to appropriate minimum
